## [6.0.0] - 2018-03-14
### Changed
- `script.async_main()` relies on scriptworker (>= 10.2.0) to:
  - initialize context, config, and task
  - validate the task schema

### Removed
- `exceptions.TaskVerificationError` in favor of the one in scriptworker
- `script.SigningContext`, `script.usage()`, `script.main()` now handled by scriptworker

## [4.2.0] - 2017-11-30

## [4.1.2] - 2017-08-30
### Added
- updated `host.cert` for new ssl cert with >30day expiration :)

## [4.1.1] - 2017-08-30
### Added
- updated `host.cert` for new ssl cert

## [4.1.0] - 2017-08-15
### Added
- added `signingscirpt.createprecomplete` from [mozilla-central](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/d3025e55dfc3/config/createprecomplete.py), and made it py3 compatible
- added a `remove_extra_files` to make sure we're not leaving any cruft behind in the extracted directories.

### Changed
- widevine zip signing now extracts the entire zipfile
- regenerate the `precomplete` file after widevine signing, for complete updates. then upload a `precomplete.diff`.

## [4.0.4] - 2017-08-15
### Fixed
- pass in the .sig path in `sign_widevine_zip` as well.

## [4.0.3] - 2017-08-15
### Fixed
- pass in the .sig path now that `output_file` works in signtool

## [4.0.2] - 2017-08-15
### Fixed
- widevine signing for mac now places sigfiles in `Contents/Resources/` instead of `Contents/MacOS/`. Given a path with an `.app` inside a `.app`, on the rightmost `Contents/MacOS/` path is changed.

## [4.0.1] - 2017-08-15
### Changed
- widevine signing now happens before macapp.

## [4.0.0] - 2017-08-14
### Added
- `sign_widevine_zip` only extracts the files we need to sign, and appends the sigfiles to the original zipfile.
- `sign_widevine_tar` extracts the entire tarball, and recreates it with the sigfiles added. This is because compressed tarballs can't be appended to.
- `get_zipfile_files` and `get_tarfile_files` lets us list the contents of an archive without extracting.
- `_get_widevine_signing_files` takes a list of file paths, and returns a dictionary of `{path: signing_format, ...}`. If a file to sign exists, but its `.sig` file also exists, we no longer mark that file for re-signing.

### Changed
- `sign_signcode` now extracts to a new temp dir every time, to optimize for task runtime speed (no more nuking the same temp dir to reuse). This temp dir is under `work_dir`, so it should be cleaned up after the task is finished.
- `sign_widevine` now calls `sign_widevine_zip` or `sign_widevine_tar` as needed.
- `_extract_zipfile` now allows for specifying a `files` kwarg. If specified, only extract those paths. If not, extract everything.
- `_create_zipfile` now allows for appending, via the new `mode` kwarg.

## [3.0.2] - 2017-08-09
### Fixed
- fixed `widevine_blessed` signing.

## [3.0.1] - 2017-08-07
### Fixed

## [3.0.0] - 2017-08-04
### Added
- widevine support
- new `signingscript.sign` module

- py36 test support

### Changed
- Moved the `aiohttp.ClientSession` creation into `async_main`
- No longer close the event loop at the end of `main`
- `sign_file` no longer takes a `to` kwarg; we always overwrite the original file, due to zipfile signing logic.

## [1.0.0] - 2017-03-23
### Added
- `example_server_config.json`
- 100% test coverage, with full docstrings and `flake8_docstrings`

- `get_default_config` now takes a `base_dir` kwarg
- moved `_execute_subprocess` to utils
- `sign_file` now returns the path to the target file
- `async_main` now copies the returned path to the `artifact_dir`

### Fixed

- bumped the token timeout to 20min

## [0.8.0] - 2016-11-09
## Changed
- `copy_to_artifact_dir` is now `copy_to_dir`, and takes a `parent_dir` arg.

## Fixed
- copy `upstreamArtifacts` files from `artifact_dir` to `work_dir` before signing.  This means we no longer overwrite chain of trust artifacts with signed artifacts

## [0.7.1] - 2016-11-09
## Fixed
- only copy files that aren't already in the appropriate `artifact_dir` location

## [0.7.0] - 2016-11-09

### Changed
- moved `download_artifacts` and `download_files` to scriptworker; compatible with `scriptworker>=0.7.0`
