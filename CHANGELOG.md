### Changed
- stop looking at signing scope format specifiers, and only pay attention to
  formats specified in upstreamArtifacts

### Fixed
- APK SHA1 detection

## [9.5.0] - 2018-11-22
### Changed
- Renamed `autograph_fennec_sha1` into `autograph_apk_fennec_sha1`. It was unused.

- Any product matching `autograph_apk_*` will be signed as an APK.


## [9.4.1] - 2018-11-12
### Added
- Enable `autograph_fennec_sha1` as single signing format for Fennec APKs

## [9.4.0] - 2018-11-05
### Removed
- Strip existing APK signatures.

### Fixed
- Autograph doesn't recompress APKs anymore. This avoids start up crashes like https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph/issues/164.

## [9.3.1] - 2018-10-29

- Added `sign_mar384_with_autograph_hash`. This is new functionality to only send the hash of the mar to autograph, to reduce autograph and network load.
- Added the `autograph_hash_only_mar384` signing format

  - initialize context, config, and task
  - validate the task schema

### Removed
- `exceptions.TaskVerificationError` in favor of the one in scriptworker
- `script.SigningContext`, `script.usage()`, `script.main()` now handled by scriptworker

## [4.1.1] - 2017-08-30
### Added
- updated `host.cert` for new ssl cert

## [4.1.0] - 2017-08-15
### Added
- added `signingscirpt.createprecomplete` from [mozilla-central](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/d3025e55dfc3/config/createprecomplete.py), and made it py3 compatible
- added a `remove_extra_files` to make sure we're not leaving any cruft behind in the extracted directories.

### Changed
- widevine zip signing now extracts the entire zipfile
- regenerate the `precomplete` file after widevine signing, for complete updates. then upload a `precomplete.diff`.

## [4.0.4] - 2017-08-15
### Fixed
- pass in the .sig path in `sign_widevine_zip` as well.

## [4.0.3] - 2017-08-15
### Fixed
- pass in the .sig path now that `output_file` works in signtool

## [4.0.2] - 2017-08-15
### Fixed
- widevine signing for mac now places sigfiles in `Contents/Resources/` instead of `Contents/MacOS/`. Given a path with an `.app` inside a `.app`, on the rightmost `Contents/MacOS/` path is changed.

## [4.0.1] - 2017-08-15
### Changed
- widevine signing now happens before macapp.

## [4.0.0] - 2017-08-14
### Added
- `sign_widevine_zip` only extracts the files we need to sign, and appends the sigfiles to the original zipfile.
- `sign_widevine_tar` extracts the entire tarball, and recreates it with the sigfiles added. This is because compressed tarballs can't be appended to.
- `get_zipfile_files` and `get_tarfile_files` lets us list the contents of an archive without extracting.
- `_get_widevine_signing_files` takes a list of file paths, and returns a dictionary of `{path: signing_format, ...}`. If a file to sign exists, but its `.sig` file also exists, we no longer mark that file for re-signing.

### Changed
- `sign_signcode` now extracts to a new temp dir every time, to optimize for task runtime speed (no more nuking the same temp dir to reuse). This temp dir is under `work_dir`, so it should be cleaned up after the task is finished.
- `sign_widevine` now calls `sign_widevine_zip` or `sign_widevine_tar` as needed.
- `_extract_zipfile` now allows for specifying a `files` kwarg. If specified, only extract those paths. If not, extract everything.
- `_create_zipfile` now allows for appending, via the new `mode` kwarg.

## [3.0.2] - 2017-08-09
### Fixed
- fixed `widevine_blessed` signing.

## [3.0.1] - 2017-08-07

- py36 test support

### Changed
- Moved the `aiohttp.ClientSession` creation into `async_main`
- No longer close the event loop at the end of `main`
- `sign_file` no longer takes a `to` kwarg; we always overwrite the original file, due to zipfile signing logic.

### Fixed

## [1.0.0] - 2017-03-23
### Added
- `example_server_config.json`

## Changed
- `copy_to_artifact_dir` is now `copy_to_dir`, and takes a `parent_dir` arg.
